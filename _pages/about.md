Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
I am a postdoctoral researcher at Johannes Kepler University. I enjoy solving difficult problems and discovering new things. I am interested in machine learning, audio perception and understanding, and generative models. I worked on different machine learning topics, including architecture design, multi-modal learning and alignment, over-parameterization and scaling laws, model compression and quantization, domain adaptation, and adversarial robustness.
